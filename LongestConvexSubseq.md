<h2>1. LongestConvexSubseq </h2>


<p>Input specification: the first line contains n and the next line contains a1, ..., an, separated by spaces. You may assume that all the numbers fit in int and that n is at most 1,000.

Output specification: the output contains one line with the maximum length of a convex subsequence of a1, ..., an.</p>
